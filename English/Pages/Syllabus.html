		Rubric: Texts and Human experiences


In this common module students deepen their understanding of how texts represent individual and collective human experiences. They examine how texts represent human qualities and emotions associated with, or arising from, these experiences. Students appreciate, explore, interpret, analyse and evaluate the ways language is used to shape these representations in a range of texts in a variety of forms, modes and media.

represent individual and collective human experiences 

Individual = unique one person (subjective)
Collective = more than one persons, life experiences = collective (everyone experience the same thing in some kind of capacity) BUT (what makes it individual = the way we experience a certain situation)

texts represent human qualities and emotions’
arising from, these experiences
The way in which different situations/experiences are specifically associated with different emotions or people are able to show specific qualities about themselves.

How texts (shows the stuff in yellow)
How = techniques!!!
Narrative voice, perspective, literary techniques, syntax (sentence structure), flashbacks, symbolism




Students explore how texts may give insight into the anomalies, paradoxes and inconsistencies in human behaviour and motivations, inviting the responder to see the world differently, to challenge assumptions, ignite new ideas or reflect personally. They may also consider the role of storytelling throughout time to express and reflect particular lives and cultures. By responding to a range of texts they further develop skills and confidence using various literary devices, language concepts, modes and media to formulate a considered response to texts.

the anomalies, paradoxes and inconsistencies in human behaviour and motivations,
Anomaly = things that go against the norm or “status quo”
Paradox = behaviour and motivations which on the surface do not make sense
Inconsistencies = behaviour and motivations which change in the moments and/or over time.
(we are focusing on how these 3 things are shown within the novel → between the character and their interactions with others).
 inviting the responder to see the world differently, to challenge assumptions, ignite new ideas or reflect personally. 
Challenges us to see the world through a different lens (character/person)
Makes us reflect on our won values/morals or ways that we would engage in a particular experience/situation
Because of this ... we reflect ( in our writing)
the role of storytelling
Who is telling this story and why are they telling the story? What do they want the reader to learn/ understand 

to express and reflect particular lives and cultures
Learning about different people and cultures 
E.g. living in a small isolated fishing town on the coast of tasmania
E.g. Australia
E.g. lives of joe, miles and harry + other people in the town 


What does this even mean?

 PARADOXES
ANOMALIES
INCONSISTENCIES
A question with no answer referring it to bein a nonlogical complex mess 
Strain behaviour that a person or thing shows thats not suppose to be there these can range from tumers to personality disorders 
Inconsistencies refers to the way things don't say the same even when you measure it leaving there to be no definite answer to a question or a person show different traits every day

Students study one prescribed text and a range of short texts that provide rich opportunities to further explore representations of human experiences illuminated in texts. They make increasingly informed judgements about aspects of these texts, for example context, purpose, structure, stylistic and grammatical features, and form to shape meaning. In addition, students select one related text and draw from personal experience to make connections between themselves, the world of the text and their wider world.

A variety of texts that focus on different aspects of the human experience
THEN I have to choose a related text provided by Miss that looks at human experiences and analyse it myself 
Basically = I have to have a REALLY good understanding of a variety of human experiences!


By responding and composing throughout the module students further develop a repertoire of skills in comprehending, interpreting and analysing complex texts. They examine how different modes and media use visual, verbal and/or digital language elements. They communicate ideas using figurative language to express universal themes and evaluative language to make informed judgements about texts. Students further develop skills in using metalanguage, correct grammar and syntax to analyse language and express a personal perspective about a text.

Reading a LOT of different types of texts
Comprehend = what is the text about
Interpret = unpack the main ideas
Analyse = look for techniques
The way you structure your ideas about PTS and finding egs of figurative language 
Personal perspective = YOUR VOICE 




Key words 
Match the correct keywords from the rubric with its definition. 

Analyse 
Appreciate 
Anomalies
Emotions 
Evaluate 
Explore
How
Human Experiences
Human qualities
Interpret
Mode 
Paradoxes 
Represent 






Analyse 
typically requires you to examine the techniques used by composers to communicate messages and ideas to responders.
Represent 
The way ideas are portrayed and represented in texts, using language devices, forms, features and structures of texts to create specific views about characters, events and ideas. Representation applies to all language modes: spoken, written, visual and multimodal.
Human Experiences
the vast array of interactions and emotions we experience on the great journey between birth and death
Human qualities
the distinctive attributes, characteristics and properties that make us human. Consider qualities such as compassion, empathy, leadership
Emotions 
In psychology emotion is often defined as a complex state of feeling that results in physical and psychological changes that influence thought and behaviour.
Evaluate 
Make a judgement about the value of
Explore
Enquire into or discuss a subject in detail
Appreciate 
Draw meaning from
How
Identify components and the relationship between them; draw out and relate implications
Interpret
Make a judgement based on criteria; determine the value of
Mode 
The various processes of communication: listening, speaking, reading, writing, viewing and representing. Modes are also used to refer to the semiotic (meaning-making) resources associated with these communicative processes, for example sound, print, image and gesture
Anomalies
something that deviates from what is normal, standard or expected.
Paradoxes 
a person or thing that combines contradictory qualities or features


In summary … 

What we are doing in this unit of work is looking into human experiences and reading books which put characters in an odd or interesting situation creating paradoxes or Anomalies in people 
Then we are to analyse and explain the books in detail
